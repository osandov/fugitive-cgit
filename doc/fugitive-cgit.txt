INTRODUCTION                                    *fugitive-cgit*

This plugin to fugitive allows the |:GBrowse| command to
work with your private cgit instance.

See |fugitive| for documentation on |:GBrowse| documentation.


CONFIGURATION                                   *fugitive-cgit-config*

Before you use |:GBrowse| you must define g:fugitive_cgit_domains correctly.

If you clone and browse cgit through HTTP(S), you can configure it as an array
of URLs as follows:

  let g:fugitive_cgit_domains = ['https://git.example.com']


If clone URL and cgit URL are different, you can configure it like this:

  let g:fugitive_cgit_domains = {'ssh://ssh.example.com': 'https://git.example.com'}


If you need more complicated settings, for example, clone URL and cgit are
hosted on different sub-directory, then you have to configure some values per
remote host.

Suppose that you use the following cgitrc:

  clone-url=https://git.example.com/cgit/$CGIT_REPO_URL
  scan-path=/srv/git
  remove-suffix=1

If git repositories are located on /srv/git and you can access to
ssh.example.com through SSH then, you can clone ssh://ssh.example.com/srv/git/repo.git
and browse cgit on https://git.example.com/repo.

In this situation you have to define g:fugitive_cgit_domains as an dictionary of
dictionaries like this:

  let g:fugitive_cgit_domains = {
    \   'ssh://ssh.example.com': {
    \     'root': 'https://git.example.com/cgit',
    \     'prefix': '/srv/git',
    \     'remove-git-suffix': v:true
    \   }
    \ }

'root' is cgit URL including sub-directories.
'prefix' is part of clone URL which is not contained in cgit URL.
'remove-git-suffix' is boolean value which states '.git' suffix should be
stripped from cgit URL or not.
